## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to opensourceascendhelp@gmail.com. 
All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Protected API endpoints with proper authorization checks

### Data Protection
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive data
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials in source code
- Secure database connection handling
- Input validation using Pydantic models

### API Security
- CORS protection with configurable origins
- Request rate limiting (recommended for production)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Proper error handling without information leakage

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker containerization with non-root user
- Health checks for monitoring
- Secure defaults in configuration
- Production deployment guidelines

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit `.env` files or any files containing secrets
2. Use strong, unique SECRET_KEY in production
3. Regularly update dependencies
4. Follow secure coding practices
5. Validate all user inputs
6. Use HTTPS in production

### For Deployment
1. Use environment variables for all configuration
2. Set up proper firewall rules
3. Enable logging and monitoring
4. Regular security updates
5. Database backups and encryption
6. SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS

## Known Security Considerations

### SQLite in Production
- SQLite is suitable for development and small-scale production
- For high-traffic applications, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Monitor database file permissions

### JWT Tokens
- Tokens are stateless and cannot be revoked until expiration
- Use appropriate expiration times
- Consider implementing token blacklisting for sensitive applications
- Store tokens securely on the client side

### CORS Configuration
- Configure CORS origins appropriately for your domain
- Avoid using wildcard (*) in production
- Regularly review and update allowed origins

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Change default SECRET_KEY to a strong, random value
- [ ] Configure appropriate CORS origins
- [ ] Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database backups
- [ ] Firewall configuration
- [ ] Environment variable security
- [ ] Remove debug/development features

## Dependencies Security

This project uses the following security-focused dependencies:
- `bcrypt` for password hashing
- `python-jose` for JWT token handling
- `pydantic` for input validation
- `fastapi` with built-in security features

Regular dependency updates are recommended to address any security vulnerabilities.
